## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Installation (Using Docker Compose)

Follow these steps to set up and run the project using Docker Compose. This method containerizes the application and its dependencies for easier management.

---

## üê≥ Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions for your operating system on the official Docker website.

---

## üíæ Clone the Repository

1.  Create a directory on your computer where you want to install the project.
2.  Open your command-line terminal or command prompt inside this created directory.
3.  Execute the following command to clone the repository (replace `[REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual Git repository URL):

    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]
    ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Running with Docker Compose

The project is configured to run using Docker Compose. The setup involves a web application container (`sge_web`) and a database container (`sge_db`) running on a shared network (`sge_network`). The web application depends on the database service.

To start the application and the database, run the following command in the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

This command will:

* `-d`: Run the containers in detached mode (in the background).
* `--build`: Build the `sge_web` image if it hasn't been built yet or if the Dockerfile has changed.

---

## üë§ Create Superuser

1.  Create an administrator account to access the Django admin panel:

    ```bash
    docker exec -it <sge_web_container_name_or_id> python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    You will be prompted to provide a username, email address, and password for the superuser.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration (.env File)

Before running the application, it's crucial to configure the necessary environment variables. These can be set directly in your Docker environment or, more conveniently, within a `.env` file in the project's root directory, which Docker Compose can then load.

1.  **Rename `.env.copy` to `.env`:** In the project's root directory, you will find a file named `.env.copy`. Rename this file to `.env`.

2.  **Set the Environment Variables:** Open the `.env` file with a text editor. Add or modify the following variables with your specific values:

    ```
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY_HERE
    POSTGRES_USER=YOUR_POSTGRES_USERNAME
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD
    POSTGRES_DB=YOUR_POSTGRES_DATABASE_NAME
    POSTGRES_HOST=sge_db
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    ```

    * **`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`**: A secret key for your Django application. Replace `YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY_HERE` with a strong, randomly generated string. **This is critical for the security of your application.**
    * **`POSTGRES_USER`**: The username for your PostgreSQL database. Replace `YOUR_POSTGRES_USERNAME` with the appropriate username.
    * **`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`**: The password for the PostgreSQL user. Replace `YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with the correct password.
    * **`POSTGRES_DB`**: The name of the PostgreSQL database to be used. Replace `YOUR_POSTGRES_DATABASE_NAME` with the desired database name.
    * **`POSTGRES_HOST`**: The hostname for the PostgreSQL server. In the Docker Compose setup, this should be `sge_db` as the web container will communicate with the database using the service name.
    * **`POSTGRES_PORT`**: The port number for the PostgreSQL server (default is `5432`).

    **Important:** Do not share your `.env` file or its contents publicly, especially the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` and database credentials. Ensure it is added to your `.gitignore` file if you are using Git.

    **Note:** If these environment variables are not correctly configured (either in a `.env` file or directly in your Docker environment), the application will likely fail to connect to the database or will use an insecure default `SECRET_KEY` within Django's `settings.py`. **Using insecure defaults is strongly discouraged for any environment beyond local, temporary development.**

Access the System
---

## üåê Access the System

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Navigate to the following address to access the Django admin panel:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000/admin
    ```

    Enter the credentials (username and password) you created in the superuser step.

3.  To access the main system, navigate to:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000/
    ```

    You should be able to interact with the application using the superuser account.
