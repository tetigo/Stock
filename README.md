# ‚öôÔ∏è Project Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local environment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

---

## üíæ Clone the Repository

1.  Create a directory on your computer where you want to install the project.
2.  Open your command-line terminal or command prompt inside this created directory.
3.  Execute the following command to clone the repository (replace `[REPOSITORY_URL]` with the actual Git repository URL):

    ```bash
    git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```

---

##  Virtual Environment

1.  Inside the cloned project directory, create an isolated Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  Activate the virtual environment:

    * **On Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    * **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    (You will see the virtual environment name `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line, indicating it's active.)

---

## üì¶ Install Dependencies

1.  With the virtual environment activated, navigate to the project directory (if you're not already there).
2.  Install all the necessary libraries and dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Django Migrations

1.  Still in the terminal, run Django migrations to set up the database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

---

## üë§ Create Superuser

1.  Create an administrator account to access the Django admin panel:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    You will be prompted to provide a username, email address, and password for the superuser.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration (.env File)

Before running the application, it's recommended to configure the environment variables.

1.  **Rename `.env.copy` to `.env`:** In the project's root directory, you will find a file named `.env.copy`. Rename this file to `.env`.

2.  **Set the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`:** Open the `.env` file with a text editor. Locate the line for `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` (it might be commented out or have a placeholder value). Replace the placeholder with a strong, randomly generated secret key for your Django application.

    ```
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_strong_and_secret_key_here
    ```

    **Important:** This `SECRET_KEY` is crucial for the security of your application. Do not share it publicly and ensure it is a long, random string.

    **Note:** If you do not rename the `.env.copy` file to `.env` and do not set the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` environment variable within it, the Django project's `settings.py` will fall back to using a default, insecure `SECRET_KEY`. **This is strongly discouraged for any environment beyond local development.**

---

## üöÄ Run the Server

1.  Start the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    You will see a message indicating that the server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/`.

---

## üåê Access the Admin in Browser

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Navigate to the following address:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/admin
    ```

3.  On the Django admin login page, enter the credentials (username and password) you created in the superuser step.

---

## üö™ Access the System

1.  Using the same web browser, access the main system via the following URL:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/
    ```

    You should be able to interact with the application using the user you created earlier (the superuser).

---

Congratulations! You are now inside the management panel and the main system of your Django application.
